# lixac: LIXA client (command line utilities) 

This image contains a LIXA client that can be used to test a LIXA server.
This image is mainly intended as a test tool or an "hello world" tool for the
LIXA project.

The most useful tool available in this image is *lixat*: it can be used to
test a LIXA state server (see https://hub.docker.com/r/lixa/lixad)

## Usage

Execute the image and start a container with command:
```
docker run --rm -it lixa/lixac bash
```

check LIXA version and build options:
```
lixa@b2eea958f107:/$ lixau -v
